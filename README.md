Demo for Sparkfun RGB Rotary Encoder on Raspberry Pi

Scott Baker, http://www.smbaker.com/

Two different demos can be run:

1) encoder.py 
  Just demos the encoder. Turning the encoder changes color
  intensity. Pressing the encoder switches colors (red, 
  green, blue)

2) vfd-encoder-demo.py 
  Does the same as demo #1, but also displays the red, green, 
  and blue values on a Noritake VFD display.

See encoder.py for connection instructions.
